# Report on the Python Pokedex Application

## Overview

The Python Pokedex Application is designed to manage and query Pokémon data efficiently. It consists of several components that work together to provide a seamless experience for users looking to access Pokémon information.

## Components

### 1. Pokedex Class

The `Pokedex` class serves as the main interface for interacting with Pokémon data. It has an aggregation relationship with the `Database` class, meaning that it utilizes an instance of `Database` to perform its operations. The `Pokedex` class includes the following methods:

- **add_pokemon(pokemon)**: Adds a new Pokémon to the database.
- **get_pokemon_by_name(name)**: Retrieves a Pokémon's details by its name.
- **get_all_pokemons()**: Returns a list of all Pokémon in the database.
- **get_pokemon_by_type(pokemon_type)**: Retrieves all Pokémon of a specific type.
- **get_pokemon_by_ability(ability)**: Retrieves all Pokémon that have a specific ability.

Each of these methods generates logs using the `writeAJson` function, which records the output of the queries performed.

### 2. Database Class

The `Database` class is responsible for managing the underlying data structure that holds the Pokémon information. It provides methods for querying the data, which the `Pokedex` class utilizes to perform its operations. The `Database` class includes methods such as:

- **insert(pokemon)**: Inserts a new Pokémon into the database.
- **find_by_name(name)**: Finds a Pokémon by its name.
- **find_all()**: Returns all Pokémon in the database.
- **find_by_type(pokemon_type)**: Finds Pokémon by their type.
- **find_by_ability(ability)**: Finds Pokémon by their ability.

### 3. writeAJson Function

The `writeAJson` function is responsible for logging the output of the queries performed by the `Pokedex` class. It takes the query results and writes them to a JSON file, ensuring that the logs are structured and easily accessible for future reference.

## Logging Structure

The logs generated by the `writeAJson` function include:

- Timestamp of the query
- Method invoked
- Input parameters
- Output results

This structured logging allows for easy tracking of the application's behavior and aids in debugging and analysis.

## Conclusion

The Python Pokedex Application is a well-structured project that effectively utilizes object-oriented programming principles. The separation of concerns between the `Pokedex`, `Database`, and logging functionalities ensures that the application is maintainable and scalable. The logging mechanism provides valuable insights into the application's operations, making it easier to monitor and improve its performance.
